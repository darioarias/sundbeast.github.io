                  <p id="description">I created this song using Garageband, it's about  how we leave life so fast but we don't appreciate everything we have around us, the people we have around us. The song starts off fast, trying to comment on how we live our lives everyday, at mid-song, there is sort of a break which is meant to show a sort of a change in concavity, a change on how we go about our everyday life. By the end of the song, the song ends up slower than it started, that is meant to show that something everything we work too hard to achieve has always been around us all our lives.

        <h3 class="post-title">Books & Designs & Music</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p title="Inquiry: What's something you enjoy doing?">Yes books. Why? Well although many people find it boring to devote your days and simply your time reading billions of words on hundreds of pages there's an invisible and addictive beauty to reading. To me, losing my mind and self in a book allows me to explore places one can never discover on their own. It brings me joy, and it brings me to tears but never will I ever regret reading all the books I've read in my time. It is quite complicated to explain, but to put it simply, books tend to build upon my imagination. It lets me picture whatever I read, my mind processing it and presenting it to me like a movie, which I find much more enjoyable than sitting down and staring at a screen to watch a movie (unless it's Harry Potter we're talking about). It puts these tiny details into every nook and cranny that my mind can handle. This idea of imagination and detailing brings me to designing. Drawing is one of my favorite things to do Although I'm not devoting all my days to a piece of paper, I honestly only draw when I feel a certain way. If my days are spent in sadness then I'll draw something that can show others how I feel. Be it through colors or the image itself. My drawings always tend to have meaning behind them. Reading and drawing for (what I believe has been) 10 years, my mind has improved in many ways. My imagination included, if that makes any sense. Moving on to my musical preferences, I do tend to put my ear buds in and listen to soothing voices and words as I read and draw. It always sets the mood and makes me feel ...feathery light? Delighted? Inspired? Well I can't say. But there's much more to it then just these few words. That's all I have for now but I shall pay another visit soon! Also I really do recommend you all who are reading this post to read more. It's great!! And to those who already do? Keep reading and keep dreaming! Peace out!</p>

        <h3 class="post-title"> About web developing </h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I started this project simply as a way to practice my skills. I wanted to see what I was capable of and how far I could take my coding skills when it came to putting together a web-page. Since usually I just play around with elements of HTML and CSS I wanted to see what I could come up with if I was to put my mind to an end goal.</p>
